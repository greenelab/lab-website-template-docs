{% hint style="info" %}
`images/fallback.svg` is an image that will be shown in place of images (in any component) that fail to load. This is useful because you may often be linking to external image URLs that can become broken without notice.
{% endhint %}

Example of using with the [section](section.md) component to make a full width banner:

```liquid
{% include section.html size="full" %}

{% include figure.html image="images/banner.jpg" width="100%" %}

{% include section.html %}
