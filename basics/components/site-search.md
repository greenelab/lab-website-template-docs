# Site Search

:eye: [PREVIEW](https://greenelab.github.io/lab-website-template/testbed#site-search)

A simple search box that links to a Google search of your site.

```liquid
{% include site-search.html %}
```

Most notably used on the template's 404 page, but you may find it valuable to put on your home page for your users.
