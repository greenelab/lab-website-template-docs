# Team members

## Add/remove members

To add or remove a team member, create or delete a Markdown file in `/_members`.&#x20;

Each file will automatically generate its own page according to its filename. For example, a file with the name `tim-member.md` will generate a page at `/members/tim-member`.

{% hint style="info" %}
After adding members, you can display them on your site with the [list](components/list.md) and [portrait](components/portrait.md) components.
{% endhint %}

Example:

{% code title="tim-member.md" %}
```markdown
---
name: Tim Member
image: images/team/some-image.jpg
role: programmer
description: Senior Programmer
aliases:
  - T Member
  - T. Member
  - Timothy Member
links:
  home-page: https://tims-website.com/
  email: tim-member@email.com
  twitter: tims_twitter
---

A bio for Tim, written in Markdown.
A descriptions of his academic studies, his recent accomplishments, his goals for the future, his likes/dislikes, etc.
One or two paragraphs is probably best.
```
{% endcode %}

**`role` vs `description`**

You can organize your team members any way you want with [list.md](components/list.md "mention") filters and by customizing `/_data/types.yaml`. However, by default, `role` is intended to be a high-level type (only a few unique ones in your organization) that you assign an icon and use for coarse list filtering (e.g. "always list PIs first, then postdocs, then undergrads"). `description` is intended for a more specific description that might be unique to each member.
{% endhint %}

## Customize member page

The skeleton arrangement and style of team member pages are based on the `/_layouts/member.html` template, which you can freely edit to your liking.
